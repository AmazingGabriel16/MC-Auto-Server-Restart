# MC Auto Server Restart

This is a smol Python script that will make it so that when your Minecraft server closes instead of restarting, the script will automatically restart the server. All because Paper's /restart has been broken for the past 4+ years without a fix and I want to do less restarting and more gaming on the server

Made with love by Gabs for the smol gabs server :>

# Requirements
- Python
- Java (for the server)
- Windows (I am not sure if batch files work on MacOS or Linux)

# How to use

Put both files into your Minecraft server folder where the .jar is located.

Change the file name of the .jar file from paper.jar to whatever your .jar file name is.

Change the auto restart value to true or false in the python script.
